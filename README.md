This is Originally a School Project in which we needed to create a Documentation on a Subject of our choice. I, together with a Friend, started this Project in February with GameMaker. GameMaker sadly didn't work out so we moved to Godot and made this.

This is by no means finished, or even close to that. We created just enough to make a Documentation were we reflected on what went wrong (Motivation, Momentum, Lazyness, Ideas that were too Big, etc). I've always wanted to make a RPG genre Game, so im most likely going
to continue this Project after the Deadline, just as a Side Project.

Even if it didn't work out as I wanted, I still learned a lot and im sure I can use this experience for later Projects, and who knows maybe I'll finish it one Day.


## What we wanted
Originally we wanted to make a Game of the RPG Genre with turn-based Combat and a few other things like a Skilltree and different classes. With time we shifted a bit on those Ideas, mostly because of problems with Time Management and Lazyness.
I learned of what was feasable and what was not, so I think it was still a experience worth my time. Something that also really got in the way of Developing was that, while it was supposed to be me and my Friend Developing around a 50/50 or atleast 40/60,
it ended up being 90/10, with me doing most of this. Later he helped me with the Documentation and especially Grammar, so It's not all that bad, but I would've still liked him to go through this Experience with me.

## Future Plans
I will most likely only bring a usable Map and finish the Combat system, it being turn-based or not. After that I will most likely not touch this for some time. Maybe when I'm bored or feel like Developing again, I could use this established 
Project and continue it. Or maybe i'll just use what I learned in Management and Developing for other types of Projects.
